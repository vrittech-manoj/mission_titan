# Mission Titon
In this game, players assume the role of a spacecraft commander who must manage and operate a space mission. The player is responsible for performing system checks, launching the spacecraft, navigating through space, and ensuring safe travel to the destination. The mission involves overcoming various challenges such as fuel and battery management, avoiding space hazards like asteroids and comets, handling temperature fluctuations, and adjusting for gravitational changes.


## Key Features:
System Monitoring:

Players must check and maintain the spacecraft's critical systems, including fuel, battery, hardware, and software, to ensure mission success.

Space Exploration:

 As the player navigates through space, they must balance fuel consumption, battery life, and navigational adjustments based on gravity and other cosmic factors

 Real-Time Decision Making:
 
  Players must make decisions in real-time to keep the spacecraft on course and avoid disaster, from low fuel to unexpected space phenomena.

  Mission Completion: 
  
  The goal is to successfully land the spacecraft at a predetermined destination while overcoming obstacles and ensuring all systems are operational.
## Game Objective:
Successfully launch, fly, and land the spacecraft while ensuring that all systems remain operational throughout the mission. Players must manage fuel, battery, and other resources, avoid hazards, and perform corrective actions when necessary to complete the mission.
